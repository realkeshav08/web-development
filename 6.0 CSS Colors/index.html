    /* BOTH SAME HTML OR BODY 
1. Using body { background-color: ... }
This is the most common method.
It works well in most cases because body is the main container for all content.
If html has no background color set, body's background color will fill the entire viewport.
However, if the page has no content and body does not have a height of 100%, the background may not extend to the full height of the viewport.
2. Using html { background-color: ... }
The background color is applied to the entire page, including areas not covered by body.
This is useful when ensuring the background color covers the full viewport even when the content is short.
html has no margin or padding by default, so it will extend fully.
3. Using Both (html and body)
Sometimes, to ensure full coverage, developers set both:
html, body {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  height: 100%;
  margin: 0;
}
This ensures the background extends fully even if the content is small.*/
